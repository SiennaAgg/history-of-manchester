                <p class="lead">Two of the largest groups contributing to the diversity of Manchester have historically been the Irish and Jewish communities. Irish migration to Manchester started in the 18th century and Jewish migration goes back to the 19th century. Both communities have roots in the Manchester suburb of Cheetham Hill – home to “Britain’s most diverse street”. The first people to migrate here were the Irish in the mid 19th century.</p>
                <p class="lead">Connections between Ireland and Manchester date back to the early 16th century due to the textiles industry as Irish fabrics were imported for use in Manchester factories. This relationship grew into food imports through the 19th century. It is reported that Irish produce accounted for a large portion of food feeding residents of Manchester and Salford at this time. The Irish population in Manchester grew rapidly between the late 18th century through the 19th. In 1773 records report it at 22,400 residents. Then in 1811 – 89,000.</p>

                              <p class="lead">By 1851 this number had become over 330,000. This is due to the impact of the Industrial Revolution and The Great Irish Famine (1845-1849). As the Industrial Revolution brought developments in transport and technology (particularly advancements in canals and railways) this brought industrialization to Manchester. Meaning many started to seek work in the city, including many Irish migrants. And of course, many more came at the time of the Irish Famine to find livelihoods. So, in the 1840’s Manchester had the third largest Irish population adding up to 15% of the total population of the city.</p>
                              <p class="lead">As they were offered low wage work, they had little income forcing them into poor living conditions. In 1835, there were 15,000 Irish residents living in only 3500 cellar dwellings. Starting in 1828, residents settled into just a few streets north of Oxford Road, known as “Little Ireland”. Living conditions here were so poor they were described as ‘Hell upon Earth’. During the period of the Irish Famine, migrants also fled to the area of Cheetham Hill.</p>

        <p class="lead">Cheetham Hill has historically been home to a multi-ethnic and diverse community. Starting with the wave of migrants from Ireland shortly after being granted township in 1838.  Its proximity to Victoria Station helped attract more migrants, particularly Jewish migrants fleeing persecution through the 18th and 19th centuries. Cheetham Hill Road is known as ‘Britain’s Most Diverse Street” and has the most nationalities of any road in the UK - with the English Language being 2nd for 48% of residents. As well as a history of Irish and Jewish migration it has been home to much more.</p>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <p class="lead">In the 1950s and 60s there was an influx of people from the Caribbean and Indian subcontinent and since: various groups from the Far East, Africa and Eastern Europe have found homes and contributed to community in Cheetham Hill. Its diversity is evident in the mixed architecture of industrial units, Irish pubs, Polish delis, Arab Sweetshops, Asian Wholesalers, Jamaican hairdressers and many churches, mosques and synagogues. It is also famously home to Manchester’s Jewish Museum due to its long history with the Jewish community.</p>
